# Converting Latitude-Longitude To Decimal Coordinate
I searched that, but I can not find simple and modern Vanilla JS coordinate converter. Then I coded this :)
Input value should be ##°##'##.##" N(or S) ##°##'##.##" E(or W) (etc: 41° 1'0.18"N  28°59'6.55"E)
Edit: improved to also accept as ##°##'##,##"(so the second part can include comma as decimal separator)
Best!
